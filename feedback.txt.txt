This was the first hackathon we as a team participated in where we had to collect the data from a sensor to run the machine learning model. The access to sensor hardware in a hackathon was really helpful since we could study the working of the sensor and play around with the raw data ourselves. Even though the sensor was an expensive one, the organising team allowed us to take the sensor back home whenever the workplace was shut down. Our team feels these were the best part of the challenge.

We have never had access to a high-resolution radar sensor before this hackathon. And neither was a similar dataset available over the internet that we could use to understand the sensor better. The engineers in the Infineon team were extremely helpful to help us with the sensor data. Better documentation regarding the sensor would have helped us accelerate our progress which clearly states the input data, the functions present, their basic working as well as some guidelines to interpret the output data of those functions.

This was a great experience for our team and one of the best hackathons we've been on. Direct access to the hardware, easy communication channels with the experts and engineers as well as the importance of the field of application kept us engaged from the start since the first day of the hackathon. But if a similar hackathon is held the next time, we would prepare ourselves with the knowledge of the sensor initially so that our understanding is stronger on the data received. This will have definitely helped us in building the representation of the model faster.

Overall this was a great hackathon and a great experience for us as students to directly engage with the industry experts to solve a novel problem.
